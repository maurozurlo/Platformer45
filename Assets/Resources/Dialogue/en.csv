Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_0_text, Hey bro, I'm really broke
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_0_options_0, What happened to you?
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_0_options_1, Better this way
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_1_text, When I died, the demons judged me and I ended up here. If I could prove my profession, I could go to a better place, one with crabs.
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_1_options_0, How can I help you?
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_2_text, I need a canvas and a couple of things more to prove my profession. I was a great artist
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_2_options_0, I'll help you
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_2_options_1, There's an art store right next door
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_3_text, Uhm, I can't move dude, someone could steal my cardboard box. Besides, I don't have any money
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_3_options_0, But you could try going there and see what's up, it's really close
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_3_options_1, Alright, I'll help you
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_4_text, No dude, nothing to see what's up, I already told you I can't leave my box
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_4_options_0, But it's just a box, it's not special. Besides, you have a bunch
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_5_text, To me this one is special, besides you don't know if there's nothing inside... like... a crab.
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_5_options_0, But in this circle of hell there are no crabs... right?
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_6_text, We've talked too much, get me the canvas and we'll continue.
Artist_001_dialogue_common_intro_6_options_0, Alright, got it
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_0_text, It doesn't seem like you have the canvas I asked for.
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_0_options_0, Not yet
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_0_completed_some_0_text, Thanks for the canvas! I'm very happy. I need help with a couple more things and I'll be able to prove my profession
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_0_completed_some_0_options_0, I'll help you
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_0_completed_some_0_options_1, Uhm, alright I guess
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_0_completed_some_1_text, I need a brush to paint on the canvas, but not one made of Kolinsky sable, no hair from weasels, ferrets or ermines
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_0_completed_some_1_options_0, I understand the ethical dilemma about animal cruelty that those brushes imply
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_0_completed_some_1_options_1, This got weird but alright
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_1_ongoing_0_text, It doesn't seem like you have the brush I asked for.
Artist_001_dialogue_quest_1_ongoing_0_options_0, Not yet
Artist_001_dialogue_common_completed_all_0_text, Thanks for completing all my tasks
Artist_001_dialogue_common_completed_all_0_options_0, OK
Artist_001_dialogue_common_completed_all_first_0_text, This is as far as the demo goes, thanks for helping me.
Artist_001_dialogue_common_completed_all_first_0_options_0, Ok
Judge_001_npcName, Skeletal Judge
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_0_text, Hello Maki, welcome to the last circle of hell. Unfortunately you ended up here, but we can make a deal if you want.
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_0_options_0, Why the last circle of hell?
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_0_options_1, Yes, tell me about the deal
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_1_text, Because you were very bad, I don't know. I don't make these decisions. In the other circles there are crabs. Not in this one.
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_1_options_0, But are crabs important? I don't know what to do with that information
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_1_options_1, Enough, tell me about the deal
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_2_text, The deal is that you help other skeletons prove their profession. If you do that, I can move you to a cooler hell, with crabs.
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_2_options_0, How do I do that?
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_2_options_1, Uhh, tell me about the crabs
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_3_text, I mean, crabs are part of the food for many animals: Many other animals eat crabs. If there were no crabs, these animals would have less food.
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_3_options_0, More information about crabs please
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_4_text, Crabs also help clean the water, build houses in the ground and make holes in the sand. This creates homes for other small animals.
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_4_options_0, MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CRABS AND THEIR IMPORTANCE
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_5_text, Finally, they can tell us if the water is clean or dirty: Some crabs can only live in clean water. If we find many crabs in a place, it means the water is healthy.
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_5_options_0, I think I've had enough, now tell me about the deal
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_6_text, Look for a skeleton on the street and talk to them, they'll surely tell you what they need and how you can help them
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_6_options_0, Perfect, gg
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_7_text, Look for a skeleton on the street and talk to them, they'll surely tell you what they need and how you can help them
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_7_options_0, Based on the information about crabs I got, it seems like a good deal
Judge_001_dialogue_common_intro_7_options_1, Based on the information about crabs I got, it doesn't seem like a good deal.

Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_0_text, Welcome, what can I do for you?
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_0_options_0, I'm looking around
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_0_options_1, Nothing for now
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_1_text, Is there anything I can help you with?
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_1_options_0, It's possible
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_1_options_1, Not really
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_2_text, Can you specify the physical and/or conceptual attributes of what you're looking for?
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_2_options_0, I could... if I wanted to
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_2_options_1, Not really
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_3_text, I understand... this something you're looking for, does it exist in the plane of reality?
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_3_options_0, Existence is relative
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_3_options_1, Not really
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_4_text, This something you're looking for, does it have to do with crabs?
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_4_options_0, There's a possibility that it might have to do with crabs...
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_4_options_1, No sir
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_5_text, You know there are no crabs in this circle of hell... and I can't help you if that's what you're looking for. Unless... you have a lot of money.
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_5_options_0, I don't have a lot of money.
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_6_text, In that case, I ask that you please leave my store, I have things to do.
Shop_001_dialogue_common_intro_6_options_0, I understand
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_completed_some_0_text, I see you were able to help the other skeleton, you're a good skeleton, for being in the last circle of hell. Where there are no crabs.
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_completed_some_0_options_0, Sure
Shop_001_dialogue_common_quest_ongoing_0_text, It seems you're busy at the moment
Shop_001_dialogue_common_quest_ongoing_0_options_0, You're right.
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_0_text, Welcome to my store, how can I help you?
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_0_options_0, I need a canvas, do you have canvases? A canvas is the only help I need.
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_0_options_1, You can't help me.
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_1_text, Sure my best canvas measures 160x160cm, only 3500 democoins
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_1_options_0, That's too much money
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_2_text, I have a cheaper one 120x120cm! only 3000 democoins.
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_2_options_0, I can't afford that
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_3_text, Hmm, I have one 30x30cm, for 500 democoins.
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_3_options_0, Ehh... I don't have that many democoins
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_4_text, Oof, times of inflation, I understand, don't worry. I have a nanoscopic canvas, 1x1nm, for only 0.1367 democoins.
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_4_options_0, Do I look as if I was made out of money?
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_5_text, Well sir, it seems you don't know the concept of money. I can suggest that in that case you look for some branches and steal a sheet to make your own canvas, I can't help you if you don't understand that goods and services are exchanged for state-backed bonds.
Shop_001_dialogue_quest_0_ongoing_5_options_0, That seems like a good option
